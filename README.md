Here's the full instruction set in README markup format:

```markdown
# Project Title

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

```
node -v
npm -v
python --version
```

### Installing

A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running.

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/yourprojectname.git](https://github.com/rayaanhasan222/ECE461L-Bike-Management.git)
cd ECE461L-Bike-Management
```

2. Install the necessary packages for the frontend:

```bash
cd project  # Navigate into the frontend directory if it's separate
npm install
```

3. Install the necessary packages for the backend:

```bash
cd backend  # Navigate into the backend directory if it's separate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuration

Explain how to configure the environment variables if necessary:

1. Set up the `.env` file in the backend directory with the necessary environment variables:

```
DB_URI=mongodb+srv://your_mongodb_uri
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
```

2. Set up any frontend environment variables in `.env` or directly in your application code.

### Running the Application

How to run the application:

1. Start the backend server:

```bash
cd backend
python app.py
```

2. Run the frontend in development mode:

```bash
cd project
npm start
```

The frontend should now be running on `http://localhost:3000` and the backend on `http://localhost:5000`.
